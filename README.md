This project prepares eBook packages to be delivered through Apple Transporter.  The packager pulls title metadata from an internal source, adds asset-derived metadata, then creates a folder with all assets inside. The eBook package must contain one or more of the following: 

* a full ePub file
* a cover asset
* a preview ePub file

I created the project to make the process of sending eBooks easier and much more user-friendly.

I'm proud of this program because I felt more confident in expanding my Ruby scripts beyond a single file.  Also, it wasn't as difficult to think in a more object-oriented way.  It needs a lot of work, but I think that this project showed me that I've made progress in programming.
